# elog

This is a little utility I use for logging my daily activities and events. It is written in Python.

Go ahead, make fun of me because this is "cringe". Whatever. I have the basilisks ready to deploy at the snap of my fingers, so you best watch yourself.

## Install
Clone this repo and copy the `elog` binary to PATH somewhere.
